Commands:
segment(point, point) - creates segment
point(x, y, z) - creates point
line(point, point) - creates line
print(*args) - prints args
clear() - clears screen
draw(*args) - draws args
help() - prints this message

Some tips:
Typing command without parentheses won't execute it.
You can't use variables to store results of commands.
Typical usage looks like this:
segment(point(0, 0, 0), point(1, 1, 1))   # this creates segment but doesn't draw or print it')
draw(segment(point(0, 0, 0), point(1, 1, 1)))
segment(point(0, 0, 0), point(1, 1, 1)))
